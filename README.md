<h1 align="center">TRABAJO FIN DE MÁSTER: Sky Field Of View Diffuse Radiation Model<project-name</h1>

<p align="center">
This project idea was derived from conducting case-studies in the VIPV technology. The nature of the PV-integrated vehicles requires them to be present within the urban environments most of the time. In order for these vehicles to generate useful energy from the solar radiation, it is important to consider that the module is mounted on top of them, and understand how much solar radiation can reach the module. The urban environments imply that the visible hemispheric view from the module’s perspective will vary depending on what kind, and how many obstacles are around it; these obstacles include buildings, roofs, facades, trees, lamp posts and vehicles. The obstacles will inadvertently affect the diffuse radiation reaching the module, and cause the solar resource and PV generation to diminish. This observation sparked a question of whether the conventional sky diffuse model is suitable in the world of VIPV.
To adjust and study the effects of local obstacles in VIPV’s performance, a proposed SFV diffuse model is implemented for estimating the diffuse irradiance. SFV (Sky Field of View) is defined as a ratio of the visible sky to the hemispheric frame, and it will be used as a coefficient for adjusting the diffuse irradiance according to the vehicle-mounted module’s hemispheric view. As the implementation of SFV reduces the diffuse component, the energy production of the VIPV system will also be reduced, rendering it more accurate. From the simulations, solar resource and VIPV production will be compared between this diffuse model and the conventional Isotropic diffuse model, which assumes the uniform composition across the sky dome.
The goal of this project is to show the extent to which the varying number of obstacles in the urban environment can affect the solar resource and the VIPV system’s production – and examine the validity of the conventional diffuse model in VIPV applications.
